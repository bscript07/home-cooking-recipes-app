# JS Back-End

The "JS Back-End" course is intensive and aims to introduce students to the development of server-side JavaScript applications on the Node.js platform, using Express.js as the framework. During the training, participants will understand how to create a server with Node.js, learn about the server-client architecture, and how to build fast and easy data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, using modern techniques and tools. One of the most popular NoSQL databases, MongoDB, will be covered, along with the Mongoose library for retrieving data from it. By the end of the course, participants will build a complete REST API from scratch using Express.js and MongoDB. The course emphasizes practical exercises, engaging students in real projects such as website development, implementing site fragments, and creating complete, modern websites with good design, modern structure, and mobile support.
